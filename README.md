# Comparative network reconstruction analyses

This repository contains the code used to perform the analyses in our publication:
"Comparative Network Reconstruction using Mixed Integer Programming", Bosdriesz et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1101/243709.

The code for the CNR method has it's own repository: https://bitbucket.org/evertbosdriesz/cnr

Contents of this repository:

* **/orton**: contains code to simulate and reconstruct the orton model. This corresponds to Fig 2 and Fig S2-S5
* **/ptpn11ko-persisters**: contains the perturbation data and the network reconstruction of the VACO, VACO PTPN11 KO, and VACO persister cells.
